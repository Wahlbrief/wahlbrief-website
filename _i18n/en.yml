questions:
  - title: "Who can apply for a postal vote?"
    answer: "Any person who is eligible to vote may vote by postal ballot instead of in person at the polling station without giving a reason."
  - title: "What are the deadlines?"
    answer: "Postal voting documents can be applied for as of now. The Federal Election Commissioner even recommends applying for the postal vote as early as possible and not waiting until the election notification has arrived. As long as the election letter with the vote cast is received in time for election day, the vote will be counted. At the latest, the election letter should be posted on the third working day before the election - i.e. Thursday, 23 September 2021."
  - title: "When can I expect the documents?"
    answer: "The documents are usually sent a few working days after your application has been received by the electoral office."
  - title: "Do I have to pay postage for the election letter?"
    answer: "No, within Germany election letters are delivered free of charge by Deutsche Post."
  - title: "I will not be at my registered address. Can I have the documents sent to another address?"
    answer: "This is possible without any problems. However, the application for postal voting documents must contain the registration address in any case. It can be stated that the documents are to be sent to another address."
  - title: "Do I have to wait for the election notification?"
    answer: "No, you don't have to, even though some online portals of the municipalities or Länder require the election notification for an online application for postal voting documents because they ask for the electoral roll number printed there. However, the informal application by e-mail to the electoral office of the main residence with the personal details is sufficient."
  - title: "Can I still vote at the polling station if I do not send the documents in time?"
    answer: "If the voting documents have not yet been filled in, the ballot paper sent to you can also be handed in at the polling station - but only at the polling station assigned in the election notification."
  - title: "Can I also post the ballot paper directly at the electoral office?"
    answer: "This is possible and makes sense if the absentee ballot papers are only filled in the day before or on the day of the election. The letter must be received by the electoral office by the time the polling stations close."
  - title: "What happens after I apply for an absentee ballot?"
    answer: "The postal voting documents will be sent to the address provided within a few working days. Instructions on how to fill in the postal voting documents are available on the <a href='https://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/bundestagswahlen/2021/informationen-waehler/briefwahl.html#96bee7af-c797-46aa-afee-cab29dd428e4'>website of the Federal Election Commissioner</a>."

    subtitle: "wahlbrief is a project run by Mehr Demokratie e.V. for the 2021 federal election. We want as many people as possible to take part in the election. <br /><br />There are many cases where postal voting is the easiest and most convenient way to vote. We help to apply for postal voting documents online from the relevant election office within 2 minutes.<br /><br /><br />

    text: "A strong democracy thrives on a high voter turnout. In Germany, this is usually between 60 and 80 percent: this means that many millions of citizens do not vote on which member of parliament represents them in parliament and which party they want to be governed by. We are committed to ensuring that more people who are eligible to vote do so, and that the hurdles for doing so are as low as possible.<br /><br />

Elections in Germany usually take place on Sundays. Eligible voters can cast their vote between 8am and 6pm at an assigned polling station at their main residence. For some people this is not possible due to work or other commitments, others are out of town or ill on the election date. <br /><br />

There are other good reasons why citizens do not vote on the day of the election, even though they would like to do so in principle. We believe that postal voting is a good way for everyone to vote easily and in good time in advance - at any time, from anywhere and free of charge. With the Corona pandemic, postal voting has become even more systemically important.<br /><br />

<b>Many people do not know how easy it is to apply online for an absentee ballot.</b> <br />wahlbrief helps to prepare the application for an absentee ballot, checks for completeness and determines the address of the responsible office based on the registration address. The application text can then be sent by e-mail to the electoral office of the main place of residence. We do not store or transmit any personal data in the process; the e-mail is sent from your own e-mail programme."
